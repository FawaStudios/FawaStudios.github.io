            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <hr />
            <h3><u><b>FAWASTUDIOS:</b></u></h3>
            <p>
                <i>FawaStudios first made it's entry into the game industry to fulfill the creative itch of an avid gamer, with the goal of creating a ton of cool and unique experiences. Beginning in 2017 (under the FawaStudios name), a large amount of nearly lost-to-time projects were created, some bad, and some downright horrible. However, amidst that steaming pile of garbage came some very valuable lessons, and a lot of experience.</i>
                <br><br>
                <i>Flashing forward, the FawaStudios train is still chugging along in pursuit of its original goal, with no plans to stop. We (being me) sincerely hope you come aboard and join us as we continue to grow, create, and (hopefully) entertain.</i>
            </p>
            <h3><u><b>MEET THE TEAM (OF ONE):</b></u></h3>
            <p>
                <i>As for me, my name is Ethan Fulmer, and I'm the sole owner and operator of FawaStudios. While that may seem small, I strongly believe in the ability of one person's vision and dedication. If I had to describe my place on that metaphorical, aforementioned train, I would be the conductor... but also the engine, wheels and cars‚Äîbasically just imagine me on rails.</i>
                <br><br>
                <i>I take a lot of pride in my work, and hope to eventually expand my team in the future. In the meantime though, I can assure you that I spend a lot of time on my games in the hope that they'll be able to inspire and entertain as many people as possible.</i>
            </p>

            <h3><u><b>QUICK TRIVIA:</b></u></h3>
            <p>
                <b>Now that you've finished reading my long-winded introduction, get to know FawaStudios further with some quick trivia!</b>
                <br><br>
                <b>Fawas The Sheep:</b><br>
                <i>You may have noticed the adorable sheep mascot scattered throughout our branding, we call him Fawas, short for "Fleece As White As Snow".</i>
                <br><br>
                <b>Clown Clear:</b><br>
                <i>Clown Clear is currently our most heavily developed project, and has been steadily moving forward for a few years now. You can find out more at: <a href="www.fawastudios.com/games/clownclear">www.fawastudios.com/games/clownclear</a></i>
                <br><br>
                <b>First Game:</b><br>
                <i>Our first video game ever made was entitled ‚ÄúBox Game‚Äù, it featured a simple player controller, a weird bean-stalk looking thing, and a big brick box only accessible after some simple parkour. If you were lucky enough to make it through the 5 jumps using our extremely primitive movement system, you would find yourself in the box. Quick spoiler warning, but upon entering the box you‚Äôd discover the most shocking plot twist displayed in modern media‚Äîa sphere. (I'm a genius, I know)</i>

            <!--<p>FawaStudios is an independent game developer and publisher based in the United States with a passion for creating all sorts of games. It was founded and currently operated by Ethan Fulmer (me), and I began by creating simple test projects in 2017 using the FawaStudios name.<br><br>In 2019, the concept of my main and largest project yet, Clown Clear, was created. Although over the years there have been several changes in vision and planning, I have stood by it and have been working on it since.<br><br>From the beginning of FawaStudios to current day, many projects have been worked on including a simple clicker game called Click Or Treat, and I have many plans for the future of game development and FawaStudios.</p>--->
